Add them back if you need them\r\n* Removed auto converting video tags with \"playsinline\" attribute. Instead, the developer pass in the video and canvas idendifier in the contructor\r\n* Removed auto create canvas element. I think adding them in HTML code is more obvious and the developer has more control over the dimension and positioning\r\n\r\n### CHANGELOG\r\n* 0.0.3\r\n    * Changed the ugliy implementation of add and remove event listener for touchstart to a more elegant way \r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n* Add function to play an audio file along with the video\r\n* To write a fall back to native feature if the mobile device is Android\r\n\r\n### HOW TO USE\r\n* Please refer to the [example folder](example)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
